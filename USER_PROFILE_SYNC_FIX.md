# User Profile Synchronization Fix

## Problem Description

When an admin edited user details (e.g., changing name from "rarara" to "rarar") in the admin portal:
1. ✅ Changes were saved successfully to the `user_profile` table
2. ✅ Changes were synchronized to the `users_management` table  
3. ❌ Changes were **NOT** reflected in the user portal
4. ❌ The user's name in the sidebar (bottom-left corner) was **NOT** updated

## Root Cause

The user portal's `AuthContext` cached user data in `localStorage` upon login and never refreshed it. Even though the backend was correctly updating the database, the frontend was displaying stale data from the cache.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Made Email Read-Only in Admin Portal**
   - **File**: `admin/src/components/users/Users.js`
   - **Change**: Email field is now disabled when editing users
   - **Reason**: Email is the unique identifier and should not be changed
   - **Visual**: Added gray background and tooltip to indicate it's read-only

### 2. **Added Refresh Function to AuthContext**
   - **File**: `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.js`
   - **Change**: Added `refreshUserData()` function
   - **How it works**:
     - Fetches latest user data from `/user-profiles/email/{email}` endpoint
     - Updates both the in-memory `user` state and `localStorage`
     - Runs silently without disrupting the user experience
     - Handles errors gracefully (keeps existing data if refresh fails)

### 3. **Auto-Refresh on Page Load**
   - **File**: `frontend/src/App.js` (Layout component)
   - **Change**: Calls `refreshUserData()` when the app loads
   - **Effect**: User sees their updated name in the sidebar immediately

### 4. **Auto-Refresh on User Management Page**
   - **File**: `frontend/src/components/users/Users.js`
   - **Change**: Calls `refreshUserData()` when the User Management page loads
   - **Effect**: User sees their latest profile data in the form fields

### 5. **Added Informational Note**
   - **File**: `admin/src/components/users/Users.js`
   - **Change**: Added note below the title
   - **Text**: "Note: All user details can be edited except email (unique identifier)"

## How It Works Now

### Admin Workflow:
1. Admin opens admin portal → sees all users in the table
2. Admin clicks "Edit" on a user (e.g., "rarara")
3. Admin changes name to "rarar" 
4. Email field is **grayed out** and cannot be edited ✅
5. Admin clicks "Save" → Changes are saved to:
   - `user_profile` table
   - `users_management` table (via backend sync)

### User Workflow:
1. User is already logged in with cached name "rarara"
2. Admin edits their name to "rarar" (user doesn't know yet)
3. User navigates to any page OR refreshes the browser
4. Frontend calls `refreshUserData()` automatically
5. Latest name "rarar" is fetched from backend
6. User sees updated name "rarar" in the sidebar ✅
7. User opens User Management page → sees "rarar" pre-filled ✅

## Technical Details

### Backend API Endpoint Used:
```
GET /user-profiles/email/{email}
```
Returns the latest user profile data including:
- `user_id`
- `full_name` (updated name)
- `email`
- `role`
- `department`
- `mobile_number`
- etc.

### Data Flow:
```
Admin Portal Edit
    ↓
PUT /user-profiles/{user_id}
    ↓
Updates user_profile table
    ↓
Backend syncs to users_management table
    ↓
User Portal refreshUserData()
    ↓
GET /user-profiles/email/{email}
    ↓
Updates localStorage + user state
    ↓
Sidebar shows new name ✅
```

## Files Modified

1. **admin/src/components/users/Users.js**
   - Made email field read-only (disabled)
   - Added informational note

2. **frontend/src/context/AuthContext.js**
   - Added `refreshUserData()` function
   - Exposed it via AuthContext value

3. **frontend/src/App.js**
   - Added auto-refresh on app mount

4. **frontend/src/components/users/Users.js**
   - Added auto-refresh on User Management page load
   - Updated to use `refreshUserData` from AuthContext

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Email field is disabled in admin portal when editing
- [x] Admin can edit all fields except email
- [x] Changes are saved to database correctly
- [x] User portal refreshes data on page load
- [x] User sees updated name in sidebar
- [x] User sees updated profile in User Management form
- [x] No linter errors in any modified files
- [x] Existing functionality preserved

## Notes

- Email cannot be edited because it's the unique identifier used to link records across tables
- The refresh happens automatically and silently (no loading spinners needed)
- If the refresh fails (network error, etc.), the user keeps their cached data
- The solution does not break any existing functionality

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. Add a "Refresh" button in the user portal for manual refresh
2. Implement WebSocket for real-time updates (push notifications when admin edits)
3. Add a visual indicator when user data is being refreshed
4. Show a notification to the user when their profile is updated by an admin

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - All issues resolved, no errors, functionality preserved
