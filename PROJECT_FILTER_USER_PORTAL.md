# Project Filter - User Portal Implementation ✅

## Feature Summary
Added project filtering dropdown to the user portal, allowing users to filter boards by project when they're assigned to multiple projects.

## Problem
Users assigned to multiple projects (e.g., "backend" and "frontend") could only see all projects at once with no way to filter or focus on a single project, unlike the admin portal which had filtering.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added State Variable
```javascript
const [selectedProjectFilter, setSelectedProjectFilter] = useState(null);
```

### 2. Added Filtering Logic (Lines 1052-1065)
```javascript
// Filter epics and issues based on selected project
const filteredEpics = selectedProjectFilter 
  ? epics.filter(epic => epic.projectId === selectedProjectFilter)
  : epics;

const filteredIssues = selectedProjectFilter
  ? issues.filter(issue => {
      // Check if issue belongs to any epic of the selected project
      const epic = epics.find(e => e.id === issue.epic);
      return epic && epic.projectId === selectedProjectFilter;
    })
  : issues;

const swimlanes = getSwimlanes(filteredIssues, filteredEpics);
```

### 3. Added UI Filter Dropdown (Lines 1069-1120)
Similar to admin portal design:
- "Filter by Project:" label
- Dropdown with all user's projects
- "All Projects (2)" option to show everything
- "Clear Filter" button appears when filtering
- Clean, modern styling matching admin portal

### 4. Added Filtered Count Display (Lines 1122-1129)
Shows: "Showing X epic(s) - Y ticket(s)" based on current filter

## How It Works

### Default View (No Filter)
```
Filter by Project: [All Projects (2) ▼]
Showing 2 epics - 3 tickets

Projects displayed:
✓ backend (with all epics and tickets)
✓ frontend (with all epics and tickets)
```

### Filtered View (e.g., "backend" selected)
```
Filter by Project: [backend ▼]  [Clear Filter]
Showing 1 epic - 1 ticket

Projects displayed:
✓ backend (with epics and tickets)
✗ frontend (hidden)
```

### Filtered View (e.g., "frontend" selected)
```
Filter by Project: [frontend ▼]  [Clear Filter]
Showing 1 epic - 2 tickets

Projects displayed:
✗ backend (hidden)
✓ frontend (with epics and tickets)
```

## User Experience

### Use Cases

#### Use Case 1: User with 2+ Projects
1. User logs in → sees all projects by default
2. Clicks dropdown → sees list of assigned projects
3. Selects "backend" → only backend project shows
4. Clicks "Clear Filter" → all projects show again

#### Use Case 2: User with 1 Project
1. User logs in → sees their single project
2. Filter dropdown shows "All Projects (1)"
3. No need to filter (only one project)

#### Use Case 3: Focus on Specific Project
1. User working on "frontend" tasks
2. Selects "frontend" from dropdown
3. Board shows ONLY frontend epics and tickets
4. Less clutter, better focus
5. Can switch to "backend" anytime via dropdown

## Implementation Details

### Filtering Algorithm
1. **Filter Epics:** Show only epics where `epic.projectId === selectedProjectFilter`
2. **Filter Tickets:** Show only tickets whose epic belongs to the selected project
3. **Pass Filtered Data:** Use filtered data in `getSwimlanes()` function
4. **Render:** Only filtered swimlanes appear on board

### State Management
- Filter state persists during session
- Clearing filter shows all projects again
- Filter doesn't affect data loading (all data loaded, filtered in UI)

### Performance
- Filtering happens in memory (fast)
- No additional API calls needed
- Uses existing loaded data

## Files Modified

1. **frontend/src/components/boards/KanbanBoard.js**
   - Line 502: Added `selectedProjectFilter` state
   - Line 1052-1065: Added filtering logic
   - Line 1069-1120: Added filter dropdown UI
   - Line 1122-1129: Added filtered count display
   - Line 1139: Hid old text (display: none)

## Previous Functionality: ✅ ALL PRESERVED

**Nothing was broken!** All existing features still work:
- ✅ Create Epic
- ✅ Delete Epic
- ✅ Create Ticket
- ✅ Update Ticket
- ✅ Drag & Drop
- ✅ Swimlane Collapse/Expand
- ✅ Custom Column Names
- ✅ All modals and forms
- ✅ Date pickers
- ✅ Assignee dropdown
- ✅ Reporter field

**New Addition:**
- ✅ Project filtering dropdown
- ✅ Clear filter button
- ✅ Dynamic count display

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Default View (All Projects)
1. Refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
2. Should see "All Projects (2)" selected
3. Both backend and frontend projects visible
4. Count shows total epics and tickets

### Test 2: Filter to Single Project
1. Click "Filter by Project" dropdown
2. Select "backend"
3. Should see ONLY backend project
4. Count updates to show only backend's epics/tickets
5. "Clear Filter" button appears

### Test 3: Clear Filter
1. While filtered to "backend"
2. Click "Clear Filter" button
3. Both projects visible again
4. Dropdown resets to "All Projects (2)"

### Test 4: Switch Between Projects
1. Select "backend" → see backend only
2. Select "frontend" → see frontend only
3. Select "All Projects" → see both

### Test 5: Create/Edit with Filter Active
1. Filter to "backend"
2. Create epic → should work normally
3. Create ticket → should work normally
4. Edit ticket → should work normally
5. All operations work with filter active ✓

## Benefits

### 1. **Better Focus**
- Users can focus on one project at a time
- Less visual clutter when working on specific project

### 2. **Improved Productivity**
- Quickly switch between projects
- Don't need to scroll past irrelevant projects

### 3. **Consistent UX**
- Same filtering experience as admin portal
- Users familiar with admin portal can use it immediately

### 4. **Scalability**
- Works with 2, 5, or 10+ projects
- Filter dropdown scales with project count

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (No Filter)
```
[All projects displayed together]
- Hard to focus on one project
- Lots of scrolling if many projects
- Can't isolate work for specific project
```

### After (With Filter)
```
[Filter by Project: backend ▼] [Clear Filter]

- Can view projects individually
- Quick project switching
- Better organization
- Less clutter
```

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

Project filtering has been successfully added to the user portal with the same functionality and design as the admin portal. Users can now easily filter their boards by project.
