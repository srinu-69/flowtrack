# Assignee Dropdown Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the ticket assignee field from a text input to a **smart dropdown** that automatically shows all team members and leads from the ticket's project.

## What Was Changed

### 1. **User Portal** (`frontend/src/components/boards/KanbanBoard.js`)
#### Added:
- **`getAssignableUsers(issue)` helper function** (lines 811-840):
  - Finds the epic the ticket belongs to
  - Identifies the project from that epic
  - Extracts all leads and team members from the project
  - Returns a deduplicated list of assignable users

#### Modified:
- **Assignee field** (lines 1300-1318):
  - Changed from `<input>` to `<select>` dropdown
  - Dynamically populated with project leads + team members
  - Shows "Select assignee..." placeholder option

### 2. **Admin Portal** (`admin/src/components/boards/KanbanBoard.js`)
#### Added:
- **`getAssignableUsers(issue)` helper function** (lines 1685-1714):
  - Same logic as user portal for consistency

#### Modified:
- **Assignee field** (lines 2107-2115):
  - Changed from `<input>` to `<select>` dropdown
  - Dynamically populated with project leads + team members

## How It Works

### Ticket Visibility (Already Working ✅)
- **All tickets are fetched without user filtering**
- Frontend filters tickets to show only those from the user's assigned projects (as lead OR team member)
- **All team members and the lead can see all tickets from their shared projects**

### Assignee Selection (New ✅)
1. User opens a ticket to edit
2. System identifies which project the ticket belongs to (via its epic)
3. Dropdown is automatically populated with:
   - All project leads (comma-separated list)
   - All team members (comma-separated list)
4. User selects an assignee from the dropdown
5. Ticket is assigned to that user

### Example Workflow
**Project: Novya**
- **Lead**: sai@gmail.com
- **Team Members**: hemanth@gmail.com, srinu@gmail.com, surya@gmail.com

**When any of these users opens a ticket in the Novya project**:
- The assignee dropdown shows:
  ```
  Select assignee...
  sai@gmail.com
  hemanth@gmail.com
  srinu@gmail.com
  surya@gmail.com
  ```

## Benefits

1. ✅ **No typing errors** - users select from a validated list
2. ✅ **Context-aware** - only shows users from the relevant project
3. ✅ **Automatic deduplication** - if someone is both lead and team member, they appear once
4. ✅ **Bidirectional consistency** - works the same in both User and Admin portals
5. ✅ **Team collaboration** - any team member can assign tickets to any other team member or lead

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Team Member Assigns Ticket
1. **Login as Hemanth** (team member of Novya project)
2. Go to **Boards** → **Novya Board**
3. Click any ticket (or create one)
4. Click **Assignee dropdown**
5. **Expected**: ✅ See all 4 users (lead + 3 team members)
6. Select **srinu@gmail.com**
7. Save
8. **Expected**: ✅ Ticket is assigned to Srinu

### Test Case 2: Lead Assigns Ticket
1. **Login as Sai** (lead of Novya project)
2. Go to **Admin Portal** → **Boards** → Select **Novya** from project filter
3. Click any ticket
4. Click **Assignee dropdown**
5. **Expected**: ✅ See all 4 users (lead + 3 team members)
6. Select **hemanth@gmail.com**
7. Save
8. **Expected**: ✅ Ticket is assigned to Hemanth

### Test Case 3: Cross-Portal Sync
1. **As Hemanth**, assign a ticket to Surya in User Portal
2. **As Admin**, open the same ticket in Admin Portal
3. **Expected**: ✅ Assignee shows "surya@gmail.com"
4. **As Admin**, change assignee to Srinu
5. **As Hemanth**, refresh and check the ticket
6. **Expected**: ✅ Assignee shows "srinu@gmail.com"

## No Breaking Changes

- ✅ All existing functionality remains intact
- ✅ Ticket visibility logic unchanged (all team members see all tickets)
- ✅ Epic creation, deletion, and filtering still work
- ✅ Project team member functionality preserved
- ✅ Bidirectional sync between User Portal and Admin Portal maintained

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/components/boards/KanbanBoard.js`
   - Added `getAssignableUsers()` helper
   - Converted assignee input to dropdown

2. `admin/src/components/boards/KanbanBoard.js`
   - Added `getAssignableUsers()` helper
   - Converted assignee input to dropdown

## Database Schema
**No database changes required** - uses existing `leads` and `team_members` columns from `projects` table.

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE - Ready for Testing**
