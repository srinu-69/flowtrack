# WebSocket Warning Fix

## Issue
You're seeing this warning in the browser console:
```
WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:3000/ws' failed: Error in connection establishment: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
```

## What This Is
This is a **development warning** from React's hot-reload feature. It's trying to establish a WebSocket connection for live code reloading during development. This is **normal** and **does not affect** the application functionality.

## Why It Happens
- React development server tries to connect to a WebSocket for hot-reloading
- The WebSocket server might not be properly configured
- This is common in development environments

## Solutions

### Option 1: Ignore It (Recommended)
This warning is harmless and doesn't affect your application. The registration and login functionality works perfectly.

### Option 2: Suppress the Warning
Add this to your browser's console to suppress WebSocket warnings:
```javascript
// Run this in browser console to suppress WebSocket warnings
window.addEventListener('error', function(e) {
    if (e.message.includes('WebSocket')) {
        e.preventDefault();
        return false;
    }
});
```

### Option 3: Environment Variable (Advanced)
Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:
```env
# .env file in frontend directory
FAST_REFRESH=false
WDS_SOCKET_HOST=localhost
WDS_SOCKET_PORT=3000
```

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Backend:** Running on http://localhost:8000  
‚úÖ **Frontend:** Running on http://localhost:3000  
‚úÖ **Registration:** Working (stores in PostgreSQL)  
‚úÖ **Login:** Working (authenticates from PostgreSQL)  
‚ö†Ô∏è **WebSocket Warning:** Harmless development warning  

## Verification

The registration system is working perfectly:

1. **Test Registration:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/login
   - Click "Registration"
   - Fill in details and click "Sign Up"
   - User will be stored in PostgreSQL database 'flow'

2. **Test Login:**
   - Use the same credentials to login
   - Should authenticate successfully

3. **Check Database:**
   ```sql
   -- Connect to PostgreSQL
   psql -U postgres -d flow
   
   -- View users
   SELECT id, full_name, email FROM users;
   ```

## Summary

üéâ **Everything is working correctly!**

- ‚úÖ Registration stores users in PostgreSQL
- ‚úÖ Login authenticates from PostgreSQL  
- ‚úÖ All data persisted in database 'flow'
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WebSocket warning is just a development notice (harmless)

**You can safely ignore the WebSocket warning and use the application normally!**
